    <p><b>Agreement to Terms of Use</b></p>
    
    <p><b>1.</b> These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of services in the SHN Reporting
    Application ("App").</p>

    <p><b>2.</b> This application is owned and operated by the Info-communications Media Development
    Authority of Singapore (hereinafter &quot;IMDA&quot;).</p>

    legally bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use this application.</p>

    <p><b>4.</b> In case of any violation of these Terms, IMDA reserves the right to seek all remedies available under the
    law and in equity for such violations. These Terms apply to all visits to this application, both now and in
    the future.</p>

    <p><b>5.</b> IMDA reserves the right to change these Terms from time to time at its sole discretion. All
    changes will be posted on this page, and your use of this application after such changes have been
    posted will constitute your agreement to the modified Terms and all of the changes. You
    should therefore read this page carefully each time you visit this application.</p>

    <p><b>6.</b> In these Terms, the words &quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot; and &quot;us&quot; refer to the Info-communications
    Media Development Authority of Singapore.</p>

    <p><b>Nature of this Application</b><br/>
    <b>7.</b> The App provides features catering to the needs of people who are
    required to comply with Stay Home Notice ("SHN"). Through this app, users can:</p>
    <p>&emsp;<b>a.</b>&emsp;Setup their SHN Reporting profile and get connected to SHN Reporting System
    automatically;<br/>
    &emsp;<b>b.</b>&emsp;Provide SHN compliance data;<br/>
    &emsp;<b>c.</b>&emsp;Receive SHN-related news and notifications.</p>

    <p><b>Third Party Terms</b><br/>
    <b>8.</b> The App may require, enable or facilitate access to or use of software or services of a third party
    ("Third Party"). In such an event, there will be terms of use of the third party software or service (the
    "Third Party Terms") that will bind either IMDA or you or both.</p>

    <p><b>9.</b> If the Third Party Terms require you to enter into an agreement directly with the Third Party, then
    you agree to enter into such agreement, and in any event, to be bound by the Third Party Terms.</p>

    <p><b>10.</b> You agree to indemnify and keep us harmless against all claims, actions, liabilities, losses,
    damages, costs or expenses (including legal costs) howsoever arising out of or in connection with
    your access or use of the aforesaid third party software or services or your non-compliance with the
    Third Party Terms.</p>

    <p><b>11.</b> For the avoidance of doubt, without prejudice to Clause 10, to the extent of any inconsistency
    between these Terms and the Third Party Terms, the latter shall prevail provided that nothing
    in the Third Party Terms shall limit the generality of your indemnity obligations in Clause 10.</p>

    <p><b>12.</b> Nothing in the App shall be considered an endorsement, representation or warranty of or by us
    with respect to any Third Party or any Third Party's content, products, services or otherwise, even
    where the Third Party websites, software or services may require the use of the App. We make no
    representations or guarantees regarding the availability or content (including its truthfulness,
    accuracy, completeness, timeliness or reliability) of such Third Party content, products, services or
    otherwise, and any use or reliance on the same by you is solely at your own risk.</p>
